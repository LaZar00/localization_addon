# localization_addon

This module is for the game Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines

I decided to code this external module to avoid changing the original libraries that the Unofficial Patch or even the original game includes in the game.

Update: 16/04/2025\
Version: 1.0 for spanish translation based on UP 11.5\
Contact: formerly ClanDLAN.net member, now in Discord.

This module includes some updates for localized versions (coded for the spanish translation):
* a. Now the '$' symbol of the money appears at the right of the value	(client.dll)
  ** IT IS MANDATORY to delete the '$' symbol in strings.txt, Name4 keyword in UIInfoStrs section. **
* b. Months and Days names in Load/Save window	(FileSystem_Stdio.dll)
* c. 'Quick Save' and 'Auto Save' words in Load/Save window	(engine.dll)
* d. Initial 'Loading...' word -m√°x 10 chars with points-	(engine.dll)
		This text appears 2 times:\
  		1. When we run for first time Vampire.exe. In this case, loader has not reached yet the module and updated any text.\
		2. After loading modules, and before intro cinematics. In this case, the loader has reached the module and has updated texts.
  
		In any case, I prefer to avoid changing 'engine.dll' directly.
* e.- When no .vcd/.mp3 files are present the game shows (press 1 to continue)	(client.dll)
* f.- 'Current' text when saving a new game, in the date/time column.		(GameUI.dll)
